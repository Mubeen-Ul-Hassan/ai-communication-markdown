# Links
One of the best things about markdown is how easy it is to make links. Put the text to display in hard brackets [] followed by the url in parentheses (). <br>

**Create links** `[text](url)` 

`[Click me!](http://test.com/)`

You can also add a link title using quotes inside the parentheses.

`[Click me!](http://test.com/ "Link to Test.com")`

Relative paths work too.

`[Go to music](/music/)`

# Images

Images are done the same way as links but with an exclamation point in front! <br>

**Add images** `![alt](url)`

`![This is the alt-attribute for my image](http://imgur.com/myimage.jpg "An optional title")`
