# Code and Code Blocks

Markdown makes it easy to display code clearly and readably. There are two main ways to show code:

- **Inline code** (for short snippets)
- **Code blocks** (for longer examples)

## Inline Code

Use single backticks ` to format short pieces of code within a sentence.

**Syntax** <br>
```
`code`
```

**Example** <br>
Use the `print()` function to display output.


# Code Blocks with Language Highlighting
You can add the programming language after the opening backticks to enable syntax highlighting.

**Syntax**
```
```language
code
```

**Example** 
```
```python
def greet():
    print("Hello, world!")

```
